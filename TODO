# TODOs
#

* Support n-, and m-dashes

* Improved hyphenation settings: currently, german requires setting explicit
hyphenation codes. These should be introduced automatically, when german
language files are selected.

* Better error reporting (maybe with the anyhow crate): currently,
mato is panicing all over the place.

* Brackets in footnotes are not working properly: the closing
bracket ends the footnote prematurely. Did not witness this
yesterday.

* `man` rendering backend

* `mato` command - similar to `groff` in that regard, that it
supports different backends for selection with:
    - `-T mom` for mom
    - `-T man` for man

* support multiple markdown file in `matopdf`

* git integration - depending on the editor used, this might be a
bit redundant: we could invoke `git add` and `git commit` on each
rendering.
