# matoedit

* Brackets in footnotes are not working properly: the closing
bracket ends the footnote prematurely. 

* `man` rendering backend

* `mato` command - similar to `groff` in that regard, that it
supports different backends for selection with:
    - `-T mom` for mom
    - `-T man` for man

* support multiple markdown file in `matopdf`

* git integration - depending on the editor used, this might be a
bit redundant: we could invoke `git add` and `git commit` on each
rendering.
