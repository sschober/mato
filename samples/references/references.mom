n the following we describe, the motivation,
architecture and implementation of \*[CODE]mato\*[CODE OFF]\&.
\*[CODE]mato\*[CODE OFF] is a set of tools to transform markdown
formatted text into pdf files. It uses \*[CODE]groff\*[CODE OFF],
GNU roff, for the production of pdfs.

ere in this section, we present the motivation
for creating \*[CODE]mato\*[CODE OFF]\&. Please see \c

Rendering performance

Using \*[CODE]groff\*[CODE OFF] was primarily motivated by its
very quick rendering times, as opposed to LaTeX
for example. A prior version of \*[CODE]mato\*[CODE OFF] even used
LaTeX as a backend, or rendering engine. But upon
trying \*[CODE]groff\*[CODE OFF] it quickly became apparent, that
it gave much better response times.

Installation size

But in addition to that, installation size of the
rendering backend dependencies drove the decision
to use \*[CODE]groff\*[CODE OFF]\&. Modern LaTe distributions, like
TeX-Live can easily take up above \[one.oldstyle]GB of disk
space and be very unwieldy to handle.

Community

Another point, why we chose \*[CODE]groff\*[CODE OFF] is its really
active and live community. The mailing list has
constant activity and since quite some time the
code base is being developed rather constantly.
.PP
Bugs that were reported are being addressed
thoroughly and quickly. And discussions are
friendly and in a welcoming tone.
