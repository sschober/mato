# Drop Caps

%%This is an example of drop caps in use.
We need to provide enough text for them to
fill three lines of text, which I set as
a default length. They are produced by
wrapping the first letter of a paragraph
in `%` characters.

%%In the middle of a line % characters should
be parsed as literals.

## Heading

%%At the beginning of a new paragraph.
