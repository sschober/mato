# Showcase

This is a test text, to test the formatting *characteristics* of matofmt. It should automatically wrap text at column 69. 
This is the next sentence, which should also wrap around correctly.
If there is a link [like this](https://github.com/sschober/mato) the url should not be broken 

# A Heading
A heading should also reset the `char_index` counter.
